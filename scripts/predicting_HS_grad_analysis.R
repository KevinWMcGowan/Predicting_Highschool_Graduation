# Predicting High School Graduation Analysis

# This R Script uses Paulo Cortez's Student Performance Dataset (2008) to create a machine learning algorithm.
  # Specifically, this report builds and compares two different classification models and uses as the primary 
  # measure of accuracy. 


# Requirements:
# - Ensure necessary libraries are installed (see library loading section).
# - The script will download the MovieLens dataset if not already present. 









































#will likely need boot strapping for small dataset...
