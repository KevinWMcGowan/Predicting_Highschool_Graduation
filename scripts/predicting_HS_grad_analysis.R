# Predicting High School Core Course Performance Analysis

# This R Script uses Paulo Cortez's Student Performance Dataset (2008) to create a machine learning algorithm.
  # Specifically, this report builds and compares two different classification models that predict pass or fail for
  # in Portuguese (equivalent of English class in US) or mathematics. RMSE is used as the primary 
  # measure of accuracy. 


# Requirements:
# - Ensure necessary libraries are installed (see library loading section).
# - The script will download the Student Perforamnce dataset (2008) if not already present. 











































#will likely need boot strapping for small dataset...
